Barcelona components with portability in mind.

## Reasoning
- Barcelona is pending a massive refactoring
- Barcelona needs its own chat registry
- Barcelona needs code that can compile without private headers

## Constraints
- Must be able to compile both with and without private headers
- Must be usable with and without private headers
